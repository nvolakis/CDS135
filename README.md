Part 2 of the 2023-24 Assignment.

Process Mining using the BPI Challenge 2017.xes event log. (https://data.4tu.nl/articles/dataset/BPI_Challenge_2017/12696884) 

Students are asked to write a Python program, using the pm4py library for process mining tasks to: 

1. Read the event log assigned
2. Display the structure of the trace (the keys it consists of) and the
event structure
3. Display the number of traces
4. Display the number of events
5. Display the different events that make up the event log
6. Construct a filtered event log in which the following are isolated
the traces of a day that you select
7. Discover process patterns with alpha miner algorithms,
heuristics miner, and inductive miner for the original event log and for the
filtered event log
8. Do the evaluation for each of the above event log (original and
filtered) with the corresponding models discovered by each algorithm.
Comments will be provided on the results in terms of fitness, precision,
generalization and simplicity. They will be summarised in a table for better visualisation.
9. Perform conformance checking either with the alignments method or with the Replay fitness method,
 and output how many traces of the event log are not fit (do not conform with the process model).
